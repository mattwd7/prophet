- don't be selfish - be there for her and help her figure out whatever she's trying to figure out. This is about her and doing what's best for her and it is great that she is willing to be open and honest with you.
- don't get trainwrecked by this conversation: be able to maintain my normal routine without taking things too personally.
- Grow from this: take the feedback and learn from it to help me become a better person.
